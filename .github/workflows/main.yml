# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runner's shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo "Hello, world!"

      # Runs a set of commands using the runner's shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo "Add other actions to build,"
          echo "test, and deploy your project."

      # Add additional steps as needed for your build process
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          # Add commands to install project dependencies here

      - name: Build Project

      # You can add more steps based on your project's requirements
